My solution was initially to sort the array and then find the largest value in the array and count how many matching values there were. However, this did not work on one of the test cases (see test input value here: https://hr-testcases-us-east-1.s3.amazonaws.com/23074/input04.txt?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ4WZFDFQTZRGO3QA&Expires=1596488336&Signature=f7C788rhQMdZTGgsIpE386AgaME%3D&response-content-type=text%2Fplain) which I think is because the input was too big at an array with 100,000 indicies. This was a bit of a hard one for me to work out. This solution uses a filter and a sort by max.Math, and since this worked, I feel like this means it takes less computing power/energy so that we were able to get my solution. 

Instructions:
You are in charge of the cake for your niece's birthday and have decided the cake will have one candle for each year of her total age. When she blows out the candles, sheâ€™ll only be able to blow out the tallest ones. Your task is to find out how many candles she can successfully blow out.
